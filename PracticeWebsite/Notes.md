Website to practice:-
Learning first then solve the problems
Hackerearth -> has tutorials to practice at initial start practicing with it -> for learning concept
Hackerrank -> has problems under topic wise daily start solving it after learning each topic  -> Daily must

codechef -> has tutorial start reading it and side by side solve questions -> For Learning and solve some problems
codeforce -> m j karthick contest
Leetcode -> similar to interviewbit once you have good practice on hackerrank start practicing in leetcode. -> solve all
GeeksforGeeks -> MustDo Coding questions , topic wise and company wise coding questions -> solve all
study ctci book
Then finally solve the problems in interviewbit and solve AIQ from glassdoor/geeksforgeeks

For each topic look into hackerearth, geeksforgeeks and codechef tutorials and solve the problems parallely in hackerrank

Learning Sites for each topic:-
1. Hackerearth 2. Codechef 3. GeeksforGeeks

Problem solve:-
1. Hackerrank 1hour daily 2. GeeksforGeeks Practice  

Advanced Level Practice:-
1. Praticipate contest in codeforce, topcoder and hackerrank and codechef

Codechef:-
- In codechef look only this site https://www.codechef.com/certification/prepare#foundation


Contest site:-
1. Codeforce, topcoder, hackerrank

1. Complete HiredinTech completely 2. Hackerearth and geeksforgeeks, codechef for studying datastructures and algorithms, for studying algorithms look for http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Main_Page site useful
2.  MIT course and one topic from algorithm book (last)
3. Jwasham github
4. Learning site and problem solve
5. before participate in contest look for m j karthick program how we written in codeforce


CodeForce:-
In problemset, contains all the problems of previous competition. Codeforce is mainly for competition.

Topcoder:-
Mainly for competition

Hackerearth:-
Mainly for learning algorithms and data structures and practicing different problems

Hackerrank:-
For Practicing problems and participating contest in beginner level

Spoj:-
- In codechef certification links there are some problems want to solve in spoj so solve that problem.

GeeksForGeeks:-
- For Learning Algorithm and DS and practicing problems topic wise. 
- And also for all company interview questions and their experience.
- Also for must do coding questions

Leetcode:-
- Contains commonly and important questions for interview

InterviewBit:-
- Same as leetcode but helpful for attending interviews.

Careercup and GlassDoor:-
- For company interview questions

Gainlo:-
- For tips and company interview questions

Daily Plan Initial:-

- Complete HiredinTech courses 
- Learn each topic in Hackerearth and practice the problem in it. And also learn parallely from GFG and codechef finally. GFG Contains the implementations in Java and also contains the best solution in terms of time and space complexity. Code Chef is for additional practice.
-practice one coding question from Hackerrank under Algorithm or DS.
Free time:-
- Watch Jwasham Github, mit press video  or courseera course or codeschool in youtube for the topic you have not understand, Quora, DZone technologies, And links file in my github repo

Intermediate Plan:-
- upon regularly practicing this, First participate in Hackerrank contest. Participate three to four contest. Then try to participate in Hackerearth contest and codeforces and finally topcoder.
- You should All courses in code monk before participate in contest.

Advanced Plan:-
- Upon regarly practicing in hackerearth, hackerrank and GFG and code contest, Now this is the time to look into ctci book, then solve must do coding questions in GFG and company coding questions.
- Finally solve problems inleetcode for practice 
- Question asked in amazon interview  search in google and youtube and from careercup and Glassdoor website
- Then FIrst prepare and upload Resume in Interviewbit and then start solving problems in interviewbit without looking into others answers.

Daily Minimum Time Required:-
- 2hrs

Point to Remember:-  Practice whiteboard coding not keyboard coding. During Interview They will lookon my thought process and my approach and my problem solving ability

Parallely while doing algorithm complete the algorithm part1 and part2 course in courseera.
Algorithms Part 1 by Princeton University | https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1 335
Algorithms Part 2 by Princeton University | https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2 148

And For DS:-
Data Structures & Performance by UC San Diego | https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance 585
Advanced Data Structures in Java by UC San Diego | https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures 219

Best Book for Algorithm and DS in Java:-
https://www.amazon.com/dp/0672324539/ -> You have soft copy of this book

Before Using any website to practice, if it is for the first time you are using the website then read the FAQ or help in that site. e.g. for Hackerrank https://www.hackerrank.com/faq

Free Time:-
https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/

Program Creek -> https://www.programcreek.com/2012/11/top-10-algorithms-for-coding-interview/ is the most useful site gives different possible solutions for a question
