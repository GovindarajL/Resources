- Good design is paramount to extensible, bug-free, long-lived code. We know it’s possible to solve any given software problem in almost limitless ways, but when software needs to be extensible and maintainable, good software design is critical to success. One way to build lasting software is to use object-oriented design best practices. You should have a working knowledge of a few common and useful design patterns, along with how to write software in an object-oriented way. You likely won’t be asked to describe the details of how specific design patterns work, but expect to have to defend your design choices.

Five Dos and Donts in System Design Int.:- From gaurav Sen youtube
1. Do not go into detail prematurely,               
2. Dont have a set architecture in mind. For the requirements or scenario given, you have to think whether you need to use particular technology.
3. Keep it simple stupid, Don't go very deep into the service have a look at entire architecture. Have a equal balance or importance to each service or each part in the system you are designing.
4. Be sure about what you are speaking, avoid speaking without knowing about it.
5. Aware of current technologies
(Defining tables and Entity relationship diagram may be asked)

Three pillars using which system design int. standing on ,
1. Clarity of thoughts i.e you can express yourself clearly to the inter. 
2. flexibility dont stick with one architecture
3. Knowledge i.e know what is going around the world.
